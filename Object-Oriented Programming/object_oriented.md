### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

81.	Create a Class Rectangle

•	Define attributes length and width. Include methods to calculate area and perimeter.

82.	Class Circle

•	Define a class Circle with attribute radius and methods for area and circumference.

83.	Class BankAccount

•	Create a BankAccount class with methods for deposit, withdrawal, and checking balance. Prevent overdraft in withdraw.

•	A Student class with attributes: name, student_id, and grades (list). Include a method to calculate average grade.

85.	Class Car **and Inheritance**

•	Create a base class Car with attributes: make, model, year. Create a derived class ElectricCar with an additional battery_size attribute.

86.	Class ComplexNumber

•	Implement a class that represents a complex number with real and imaginary parts. Overload addition and subtraction operators (if you want to practice operator overloading in Python).

87.	Class Point

•	Represent a point in 2D space. Add methods to set coordinates and calculate distance from another Point object.

88.	Classmethod and Staticmethod

•	Create a class with a regular instance method, a class method, and a static method. Demonstrate their differences.

89.	Property Decorators

•	Create a class that uses @property to control getting and setting of a private attribute.

90.	Class Employee with Inheritance

•	Base class Employee (name, ID, salary) and child class Manager (with additional attributes). Override a method in the subclass.
