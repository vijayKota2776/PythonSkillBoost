### Data Structures (Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets)

31.	List Operations

•	Create a list of integers. Perform append, insert, remove, pop, and display the list at each stage.

32.	Maximum and Minimum in a List

•	Take a list of numbers from the user and find the maximum and minimum values.

33.	Second Largest Element

•	In a list of unique integers, find the second largest element.

34.	Sum and Average of a List

•	Prompt the user for a list of numbers. Calculate and print the sum and average.

35.	Count Positive, Negative, Zero

•	In a list of integers, count how many are positive, negative, or zero.

36.	Remove Duplicates from a List

•	Prompt for a list of integers (possibly with duplicates). Create a new list with duplicates removed.

37.	Concatenate Two Lists

•	Input two lists from the user and concatenate them.

38.	List Reversal

•	Write a function to reverse a given list in place.

39.	Find Common Elements of Two Lists

•	Given two lists, find the common elements and store them in a new list.

40.	Element-wise Sum of Two Lists

•	Given two lists of equal length, create a third list that stores the element-wise sum.

41.	Tuple Creation and Access

•	Create a tuple of strings. Prompt the user for an index and print the element at that index.

42.	Tuple to List

•	Convert a user-defined tuple to a list, modify it, and convert it back to a tuple.

43.	Check if Element Exists in Tuple

•	Prompt the user for an element and check if it exists in the tuple.

44.	Dictionary: Word Count

•	Prompt the user for a string and build a dictionary that counts how many times each word appears.

45.	Dictionary: Student Grades

•	Create a dictionary with student names as keys and their grades as values. Prompt the user for a name and display the grade.

46.	Dictionary: Keys and Values

•	Create a dictionary and then print just its keys and just its values separately.

47.	Merge Two Dictionaries

•	Given two dictionaries, merge them into a new dictionary.

48.	Invert Dictionary

•	Given a dictionary {key: value}, swap keys and values if all values are unique (produce {value: key}).

49.	Set Operations

•	Prompt the user for two lists, convert them to sets, and then display the union, intersection, and difference of these sets.

50.	Set Membership Testing

•	Given a set of names, prompt the user for a name. Check if it is in the set or not.
