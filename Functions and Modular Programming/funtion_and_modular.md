### Functions and Modular Programming

21.	Create a Simple Calculator (Functions)

•	Write four functions: add(a, b), subtract(a, b), multiply(a, b), and divide(a, b). Then prompt the user for two numbers and the operation. Use the corresponding function to output the result.

22.	Power Function

•	Write a function power(base, exponent) that returns base^exponent without using the built-in ** operator (use a loop).

23.	Count Characters in a String (Function)

•	Write a function that accepts a string and returns the number of characters in it.

24.	Check Prime (Function)

•	Write a function is_prime(n) to check if a number n is prime. Test it with user input.

25.	Fibonacci Series (Function)

•	Write a function fibonacci(n) that returns a list of the first n Fibonacci numbers.

26.	GCD of Two Numbers

•	Write a function gcd(a, b) that computes the greatest common divisor of a and b.

27.	LCM of Two Numbers

•	Write a function lcm(a, b) that finds the least common multiple of a and b. Hint: lcm(a, b) = abs(a*b)/gcd(a,b).

28.	Factorial (Recursive)

•	Write a recursive function to compute the factorial of a number.

29.	Tower of Hanoi

•	Write a recursive function to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle for n disks.

30.	Count Occurrences of an Element

•	Write a function count_occurrences(lst, x) that returns how many times x appears in the list lst.
